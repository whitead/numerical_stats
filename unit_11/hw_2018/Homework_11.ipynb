    "Answer each using Python and Markdown. First, state what type of optimization (2 points), the number of dimensions (1 point), if it's convex (1 points), and if there are bounds or constraints (2 points). Next, write out any constraints or rearrangements of equations in Markdown. For example, if you use root finding you should write out the expression for which you're finding roots (e.g., $x^2 = 4$ becomes $x^2 - 4 = 0$). Solve the problem ( 6 points) and then graph your solution (4 points). **You must make a graph showing a graph of the equation and the otpimum point for each problem** 16 points per problem. You must also print your numerical answer.\n",
