    "3. Using the array from question 3.1, create an array representing a $\\lambda = 3$ exponential distribution on the interval $[0,30)$. *Note: the word `lambda` is a reserved word in python, meaning you cannot use it for a variable name. You can tell if a variable is reserved because it is a different color/font than other variables in ipython. Also, when applying mathematical functions to numpy arrays, you must use the numpy versions, for example `numpy.cos` instead of `math.cos`*\n",
    "4. Using a `for` loop and the array from Question 3.1, compute the expected value of the exponential distribution. To evaluate the integral, use $\\int f(x)dx = \\sum_i f(x_i) \\Delta x$, where $\\Delta x$ is the spacing between your points and $f(x_i)$ is the function evaluated at point $x_i$. As you know, it should be $1/3$.\n",
