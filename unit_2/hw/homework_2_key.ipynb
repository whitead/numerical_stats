    "Now we need to know how many ways each combination of 10 can be permutated into different teams. Let's consider 4 characters  broken up into two teams to simplify. Let's represent the permutations as a sequence of numbers (e.g., 1234). Take the first two numbers as team A and the second two as team B. So the permutation 1234 is equivalent to 2134, 1243, and 2143. See the pattern? Every 4 permutations are equivalent to the teams becasue we can rearrange team A, team B or team A and team B. Mathematically, we have $n!$ permutations and can rearrange one of the teams by $\\frac{n}{2}!$ without changing who's on the team.
